     * Returns the encrypted version of the original string using Affine Cipher.
     *
     * Conditions on original string:
     * - Should be a non-empty string and must contain at least one letter or number.
     *
     * Conditions on the arguments:
     * - Arg 1: first encryption parameter.
     *   This input should be an integer co-prime to 62 between 0 and 62: 1, 3, 5, 7, 
     *   9, 11, 13, 15, ... 61
     * - Arg 2: second encryption parameter.
     *   This input should be an integer >= 1 and < 62.
     *
     * Description of the Cipher: 
     * - Each character in the alphabet is assigned a numeric value between 0 and 35 based on its position 
     *   in the alphabet (i.e., "a"=0, "b"=1, ..., "z"=25, "A"=26, "B"=27, ..., "Z"=51, "0"=52, "1"=53, ..., "9"=61)
     *   Note that the alphabet contains letters and numbers.
     * - For each character in the alphabet, where the numeric value is x, the encoded value of the 
     *   letter is defined as E(x) = (ax + b) % 62 where a and b are the values of Arg 1 and Arg 2 
     *   respectively, as in an Affine Cipher.
     * - The encoded character for the input character is calculated by taking the encoded number, which 
     *   is a value between 0 and 61, and translating it back into a character 
     *   (again, where "a"=0, "b"=1, ..., "z"=25, "A"=26, "B"=27, ..., "Z"=51, "0"=52, "1"=53, ..., "9"=61).
     * - All non-alphanumeric characters must remain unchanged.
     *
     * Examples:
     * - Inputs:
     *   Entry Text = "Cat & 5 DogS"
     *   Arg Input 1 = 5
     *   Arg Input 2 = 3
     * - Output:
     *   Text Encrypted = "tdK & O ylHL"
     * - Explanation:
     *   "C" has value 28, (28 * 5 + 3) % 62 = 19, 19 corresponds to "t".
     *   "a" has value 0, (0 * 5 + 3) % 62 = 3, 3 corresponds to "d".
     *   …
     *   " ", "&", and " " are unchanged
     *   "5" has value 57, (57 * 5 + 3) % 62 = 40, 40 corresponds to "O".
     *   " " is unchanged
     *   …
     *
     * @param arg1 first encryption parameter
     * @param arg2 second encryption parameter
     * @return String encrypted using Affine Cipher
     * @throws NullPointerException If the original string is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the original string is not null, and any of the following conditions are not satisfied:
     *                                  1. arg1 is should be an integer co-prime to 62 between 0 and 62
     *                                  2. arg2 should be an integer >= 1 and < 62.
